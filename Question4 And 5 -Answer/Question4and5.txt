5.If you are to start a software company, name 2 people from your batch whom you will choose as your partner and why?

I would  choose Vikas and Siddu as my partners.Because they both have amazing technical knowledge required to run a software company and they are also well equipped with business management skills
and ability to communicate and deal with large clients.Adding to that they are very good team players so having them as my partners will benefit my company in several ways.
